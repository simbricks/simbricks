Getting Started
###################################

Welcome! We are happy that you want to give SimBricks a try.

The easiest way to get started with just running a simulation is to use our
Docker images, see our `README
<https://github.com/simbricks/simbricks#using-pre-built-docker-images>`_ for
details.

Where you go from here depends on what you plan to do with SimBricks. Our
:ref:`sec-howto` section provides instructions for some common scenarios. In
general, we suggest starting with reading up on our orchestration framework, see
:ref:`sec-orchestration`, and experimenting with building different simulation
configurations, e.g. :ref:`sec-howto-createrun` and :ref:`sec-howto-nodeconfig`.
This will enable you to assemble and customize various configurations of
SimBricks simulations.

If you are planning on making changes to the implementation of SimBricks
components, you may next want to make sure you can build SimBricks from source.
For instructions, refer to our `Quick Start section in the README
<https://github.com/simbricks/simbricks#quick-start>`_. We recommend diving into
our :ref:`sec-devel` for learning about the SimBricks architecture, internals,
and APIs.

If you run into problems please refer to :ref:`sec-troubleshoot-getting-help`.
