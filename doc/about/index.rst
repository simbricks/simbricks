SimBricks is a platform for creating and simulating virtual prototypes of modern heterogeneous computer systems.

SimBricks enables virtual prototyping of complete computer systems, rather than individual components. It allows to 
create virtual prototypes by combining and connecting multiple different existing simulators for individual system 
components into a complete system simulation. SimBricks **does not** replace existing simulators for individual components, 
but instead enables users to connect together multiple existing simulators, even from different vendors and never designed 
to interoperate, into a complete system. 

Key Features:

* **Easy**: Easily create and execute virtual representations of your system through simple Python.
* **Fast**: Efficient synchronization mechanisms in SimBricks enable fast simulation execution.
* **Full-System**: Create full-system virtual prototypes with all components you would find in the real world using SimBricks.
* **Extensible**: Easily integrate your component simulators.
* **Scalable**: Create large-scale virtual prototypes with thousands of components.
